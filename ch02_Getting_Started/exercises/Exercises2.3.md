Using Figure 2.4 as a model, illustrate the operation of merge sort on the array
A = <3, 41, 52, 26, 38, 57, 9, 49>.

**Solution:**
<table>
<tr>
  <td colspan="8">[3, 9, 26, 38, 41, 49, 52, 57]</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td colspan="4">[3, 26, 41, 52]</td>
  <td colspan="4">[9, 38, 49, 57]</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td colspan="2">[3, 41]</td>
  <td colspan="2">[26, 52]</td>
  <td colspan="2">[38, 57]</td>
  <td colspan="2">[9, 49]</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>3</td> <td>41</td> <td>52</td> <td>26</td> <td>38</td> <td>57</td> <td>9</td> <td>49</td>
</tr>
</table>

pseudocode:

RECURSIVE-INSERTION-SORT(A, n):
    if n > 1
        RECURSIVE-INSERTION-SORT(A, n - 1)
        INSERT(A, n)

Referring back to the searching problem (see Exercise 2.1-3), observe that if the
sequence A is sorted, we can check the midpoint of the sequence against v and
eliminate half of the sequence from further consideration. The binary search algorithm repeats this procedure, halving the size of the remaining portion of the
sequence each time. Write pseudocode, either iterative or recursive, for binary
search. Argue that the worst-case running time of binary search is Î˜(lgn).
